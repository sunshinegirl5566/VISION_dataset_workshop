91,1,My father has been abusive towards me my whole life and my mom who i__e become somewhat codependent on because I am dealing with severe mental health issues due to family history and also trauma from being abused and beaten by my dad as a kid and she has normalized all of this and excuses and forgives my dad who needs help

108,1,I can__ do this anymore basically it__ your typical drunk father abuse but this time it__ not my father it__ stepfather
109,1, I was literally thinking about taking him back because of how messed up I am in my head after living with an abuser for so long
111,1, She has moved away from the mother
113,1, Cops got called and all they did was take the gun for a little bit and then tell my friend that should his dad seriously try to hurt him
114,1,So a week ago my abuser was arrested and I was devastated

135,1,im currently in a long distance relationship and my gf is being abused by her brother physically 
136,1,My boyfriend of 2 years has been extremely abusive
137,1,   I kind of just wanted to ask for your opinion on this since I__ not sure if what I have experienced counts as domestic abuse since it isn__ too dramatic and probably not as horrible compared to what others have experienced
138,1,I saw you looking at me  My heart started to race  I didn__ know what was about to take place  You looked calm  But i knew that wasn__ the case  It was only a matter of time  Before you would hit me in my face  Maybe I can keep the peace  Maybe I can make you happy  I put on some lace  And a smile on my face  If I were with anyone else  They__ speak on how I stood with such grace  But to you  I was always just waste
139,1,    I would like to press charges against my abuser
140,1,How can someone beat the crap out of you and love you? I__ still with her an I feel like I__ strong enough to leave now but I question if I should
141,1, Then I remember the lights being turned on by my fathers hand that was reaching in and blood smearing all over the wall as he tried unsuccessfully to get in
142,1,I've been thinking about reaching out to someone about my domestic violence situation because I don't know what other steps to take and I keep reading that you should tell someone about your situation
143,1, No respect for me I doubt can you need me to stand up for myself a little bit more so yeah okay I'll just barely little bit but I know I will OK and I just barely even just start looking like
